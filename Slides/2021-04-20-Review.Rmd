# Tutoring Data

.pull-left[
An observational study that examined the effects of tutoring services on students' grades in English courses in an online college.

```{r}
data(tutoring, package = 'TriMatch')
tutoring <- tutoring %>%
	mutate(treat2 = treat %in% 
		   	c('Treat1', 'Treat2'),
		   Pass = Grade >= 2)
```

# Types of Data

**Quantitative variables** represent amounts of things (e.g. the number of trees in a forest). Types of quantitative variables include:

* **Continuous** (a.k.a ratio variables): represent measures and can usually be divided into units smaller than one (e.g. 0.75 grams).
* **Discrete** (a.k.a integer variables): represent counts and usually canâ€™t be divided into units smaller than one (e.g. 1 tree).

**Categorical variables** represent groupings of things (e.g. the different tree species in a forest). Types of categorical variables include:

* **Ordinal**: represent data with an order (e.g. rankings).
* **Nominal**: represent group names (e.g. brands or species names).
* **Binary**: represent data with a yes/no or 1/0 outcome (e.g. win or lose).

# Central Limit Theorem

The distribution of the sample mean is well approximated by a normal model:

$$ \bar { x } \sim N\left( mean=\mu ,SE=\frac { \sigma  }{ \sqrt { n }  }  \right)  $$

where SE represents the **standard error**, which is defined as the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. In most cases $\sigma$ is not known, so use $s$.


---
# Central Limit Theorem (cont.)

Consider the following population...

```{r, fig.height = 5.3}
N <- 1000000
pop <- rbeta(N,2,20)
ggplot(data.frame(x = pop), aes(x = x)) + geom_density()
```

---
# Estimating Sampling Distributions

Here, we will estimate 4 sampling distributions by taking 1,000 random samples from the population with sample sizes of 5, 10, 20, and 30 each.

```{r, cache = TRUE}
n_samples <- 1000
df <- tibble(n = rep(c(5, 10, 20, 30), each = n_samples),
			 mean = NA_real_)
for(i in 1:nrow(df)) {
	df[i,]$mean <- mean(sample(pop, size = df[i,]$n))
}
```

---
# Sampling Distributions

```{r}
ggplot(df) + geom_density(aes(x = mean, color = factor(n))) +
	scale_color_brewer('Sample Size', type = 'qual', palette = 2)

```

---
# Null Hypothesis Testing


* We start with a null hypothesis ( $H_0$ ) that represents the status quo.
* We also have an alternative hypothesis ( $H_A$ ) that represents our research question, i.e. what we're testing for.
* We conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, either via simulation or traditional methods based on the central limit theorem.
* If the test results suggest that the data do not provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis, we stick with the null hypothesis. If they do, then we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

# Regression

> Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome variable') and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features').  
.right[.font70[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis)]]

Regression problems take on the following form:

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_i x_i$$
For *i* predictor variables where $\beta_0$ is the intercept and $\beta_i$ is the slope for predictor $i$.

---
# Statistical Assumptions

Statistical tests make some common assumptions about the data they are testing:

1. **Independence of observations** (aka no autocorrelation): The observations/variables you include in your test are not related (for example, multiple measurements of a single test subject are not independent, while measurements of multiple different test subjects are independent).

2. **Homogeneity of variance**: the variance within each group being compared is similar among all groups. If one group has much more variation than others, it will limit the test's effectiveness.

3. **Normality of data**: the data follows a normal distribution (aka a bell curve). This assumption applies only to quantitative data.
