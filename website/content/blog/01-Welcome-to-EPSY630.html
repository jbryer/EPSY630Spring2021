<p>Welcome to EPSY 630! My name is Dr.Â Jason Bryer and I will be your instructor for this semester. I am currently an Assistant Professor at the School of Professional Studies at CUNY and a graduate of the Educational Psychology and Methodology program in 2014. Couple of important notes as you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>The course syllabus located here: <a href="https://epsy630.bryer.org/course-overview" class="uri">https://epsy630.bryer.org/course-overview</a> I will post all course materials there. Blackboard will be used primarily for submitting assignments. <strong>Please read the syllabus carefully!</strong> Send me any questions you may still have about the course.</li>
<li>Complete this <a href="https://forms.gle/fPL2oWCAYwRWwp1R9">Google Form</a> as soon as possible. I will use some of the data (in aggregate) in the meetup.</li>
<li><a href="">Join the Slack channel by clicking here</a>. This will be our primary mode of communication. For private communications, you can either send private Slack messages or email me at <a href="mailto:jbryer@albany.edu">jbryer@albany.edu</a>.</li>
<li>The best way to reach me is by Slack or email at <a href="mailto:jbryer@albany.edu">jbryer@albany.edu</a>. If you would prefer to talk on the phone or setup a Zoom session, it is best to suggest some times by email first.</li>
<li>Our class meetings will be on Tuesday at 4:30pm.</li>
<li>I am looking forward to getting to know everyone and a fantastic semester! Good luck!</li>
